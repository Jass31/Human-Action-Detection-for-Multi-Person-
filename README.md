# Human-Action-Detection-for-Multi-Person-
This project implements a real-time multi-person pose classification system using YOLOv11Pose for pose detection and a custom LSTM-based neural network for action classification. The application can process both video files and live webcam streams, detecting and classifying human actions based on pose keypoints.
